- Onion Browser now relies on Orbot for Tor network access.
  Orbot handles all network routing and Onion Browser just makes sure that all requests get cancelled, when Orbot stops.
- Replaced old `UIWebView` with newer `WKWebView`. Parallelized loading, newer web standards support.
- Finally supports media streaming over Tor!
- Minimum iOS version is now 15, as that's what Orbot supports.
- Removed HTTPSEverywhere. That's built into iOS 15, already.
- Removed WebRTC blocking. Not a danger anymore.
- Replaced outdated DNT header ("Do-Not-Track") with new GPC header ("Global-Privacy-Control").
- Added support for multiple windows on iPad.
